title: "ADR006: Implementation of Timeout Pattern"
description: >
  Architecture Decision Record (ADR) to implement of Timeout Pattern
---

*Status: [Open]*

## Context:

There is a need to prevent indefinite blocking during service calls and enhance the overall responsiveness of the system.

## Decision:

Implement the Timeout Pattern to set time limits for interactions with backend services, ensuring timely responses and preventing indefinite blocking.

## Consequences:

* Improved system responsiveness by avoiding prolonged waits for unresponsive services.
* Mitigation of potential performance bottlenecks due to indefinite blocking during service calls.
## Risks and Considerations
While the Timeout Pattern offers significant advantages, it is essential to consider potential risks and challenges:

1. **Configurability:** Ensuring that the timeout values are configurable and adjustable based on different service requirements and environmental conditions.

2. **Handling Timeout Events:** Implementing robust mechanisms for handling timeout events to provide meaningful feedback to users and log relevant information for diagnostics.

3. **Communication and Coordination:** Communicating the introduction of timeout mechanisms to relevant stakeholders and coordinating any necessary changes or adjustments in their systems or workflows.
